# ✉️ AI-Powered Email Generator & Sender (n8n Workflow)

This n8n workflow takes email topics or prompts from a Google Sheet, generates full emails using an LLM (Groq API or OpenAI), and sends them automatically via SMTP.  
Perfect for automating personalized email campaigns with zero manual writing.

## 🔧 Use Case

Generate and send AI-written emails to:

- 📨 Cold prospects (B2B outreach)
- 📬 Newsletter subscribers
- 🎯 Nurture leads or clients
- 🤖 Respond automatically based on dynamic input

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Prompt Input**  
   Email subjects or custom prompts are provided in a Google Sheet or via webhook.

2. **Text Generation (AI)**  
   Each prompt is sent to a language model (e.g., Groq with LLaMA3 or OpenAI) using an API call. The model returns a full email body.

3. **Email Formatting**  
   The result is formatted (Markdown, HTML, or plain text) and passed to the email node.

4. **Email Sending**  
   The final email is sent via SMTP, Gmail API, or another mail service.
